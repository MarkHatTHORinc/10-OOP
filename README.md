## Description 📰
```md
Using node.js this application generates an ouput file based upon a template. 
The template contains questions that the application uses to prompt the user 
for variable input. The template and output file names can be passed as parameters 
to the application or the user will be prompted for the file. The user can hit 
enter for default file names.
The user can enter multiple answers to each question. When the user is done 
entering answers for a specific question the user enters DONE (case insensitive). 
The user can also enter STOP to stop the application from running. If STOP is 
entered no work is saved. The user also has an option to enter BREAK to cause 
the answers to be written to storage and will allow the user to restart later
where they left off.
